      <p>This license is the successor to the Mozilla Public License v1.1. It is Free. By default, the MPLv2.0 is GPL Compatible, however, there are several situations where it would not be considered GPL compatible:
      </p><p>1) If the code is available under the MPLv1.1, but not also dual or tri-licensed under the GPL and/or LGPL, then leveraging clause 6.2 in MPLv1.1 to use Covered Code under the terms of "any subsequent version of the License" permits use of that Covered Code under the MPLv2.0 terms, but it is not considered to be GPL Compatible.
      </p><p>2) If the initial MPLv2.0 copyright holder explicitly states that the code is "Incompatible with Secondary Licenses", then they are opting out of the compatibility scheme, and the license is GPL-incompatible.

      <pre>Mozilla Public License, version 2.0
1. Definitions

1.1. “Contributor”

    means each individual or legal entity that creates, contributes to the creation of, or owns Covered Software.
1.2. “Contributor Version”

1.5. “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”

    means

        that the initial Contributor has attached the notice described in Exhibit B to the Covered Software; or

        that the Covered Software was made available under the terms of version 1.1 or earlier of the License, but
not also under the terms of a Secondary License.

1.6. “Executable Form”

    means any form of the work other than Source Code Form.
1.7. “Larger Work”

Covered Software.
1.8. “License”

    means this document.
1.9. “Licensable”

    means having the right to grant, to the maximum extent possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or

Contributor Version.
1.12. “Secondary License”

definition, “control” means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or
beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. License Grants and Conditions
2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

    under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use,
reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on
an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

    under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise
transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the
date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or
licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding
Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

    for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

    for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the
combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or

    under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may
be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a
subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under
the terms of Section 3.3).
2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has
sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair
dealing, or other equivalents.
2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
3. Responsibilities
3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which
You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the
Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may
not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must
inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in
a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

    You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms,
provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the
Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the
requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices,
disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual
inaccuracies.
3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation
is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this
License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its
terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some
reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered
Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
to termination shall survive termination.
6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either
expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of
defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and
performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You
(not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
License except under this disclaimer.
7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages.
This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply
to You.
8. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant
maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,
without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to
bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
9. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against
the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
10. Versions of the License
10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license
steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.
10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the
license steward.
10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software,
you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references
to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of
this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

    This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the
MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in
a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for
such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

    This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by the Mozilla Public
License, v. 2.0.
